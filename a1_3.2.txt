As the number of samples increases, the accuracy increases too.
With larger train set, the model can learn each class better,
since there are more samples to show the characteristics of classes and help the model to classify them.
We may see a decrease in accuracy for larger sample sizes due to overfit but it's not happening here (I saw it with other set of samples)
